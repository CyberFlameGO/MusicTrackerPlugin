# Spotify friend tracker
With the spotify friend tracker, you can see what your friends are listening to with spotify, simply by looking at their name in chat.
We handily format the name of the song in front of the user's name, cutting it off if the name is too long.
Through hovering over the song name, you can get more information such as the album, artist and the link.
